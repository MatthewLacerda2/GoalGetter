# GoalGetter

An educational app with an AI-Tutor

## How it works

- Goal
  At the onboarding the user states what he wants to learn, and answers some follow-up questions
- Objective
  The next immediate step towards the goal
  Once the student shows they dominate the objective, we create a new one
- Lessons
  Multiple Choice questions with didatic purpose
  Subjective questions to stimulate thinking
  Subjective questions aiming at assessing the student's knowledge
- Tutoring
  A chatbot with knowledge about the user
- Gamefication
  Leaderboards
  Missions
  Achievments
- Resources
  Recommendations of Websites, Youtube Channels and eBooks

All content is custom-tailored for the user. It's a 1:1 Tutor App!

## Philosophy

- Goal
  Must be the most ambitious possible
- Small steps
  Each objective is the smallest step possible above the student's current level
- Gamification
  We have XP and Streaks, aimed at user-retention
- 1:1 Tutoring
  We record data and context all the time. That is used to create a custom-tailored experience

## Tech Stack and Infrastructure

This is a home-deployed app. We only have one desktop at home, tunneling to Cloudflare. This isn't meant to scale unless it proves itself commerciable.

Flutter: - Webapp and Android
FastApi / Pytest
Client_SDK: - Generated by OpenApi code-generator, using swagger-ui's openapi.json
Terraform Cloudflare setup

We use Gemini as our AI

# How to run

You will need a Gemini API Key. You can get it in a free tier at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys). GCP account is probably required.

Copy example.env into a .env and replace the API key.

`docker-compose --profile dev up -d`

Use Python 3.12.10 to create your venv and then run the migrations. Then:
Backend: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
Frontend: `flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8080`

Whenever you change the api, you can get the .json specs at [swagger-ui](http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.docs)

Then generate the Client_sdk with:
`openapi-generator-cli generate -i ./openapi.json -g dart -o ./client_sdk`

_The web version is meant for the MVP. This app is meant as a mobile app only_

# Architecture

_This is a rabbit hole_

Google Gemini

Cloudflare Tunnel to reverse proxy so we can home-deploy
Cloudflare R2 to backup the SQL

Re-use other people's content to save on generation

# Note

Gemini does not support pydantic's Field annotators
