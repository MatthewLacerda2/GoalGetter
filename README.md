# GoalGetter

An app to setup a weekly-routine with long term goals

# How it works

- Goals: define what you want to do
    It can be something endless, like bodybuilding,
    Or an endgoal, like building a robot
    You can look at the goal's history
    Edit it as your plan evolves
- Agenda: create your weekly schedule
    Look what you have for the day of the week
    Keep consistent in your goals
- Xp: get reminded and rewarded for progress (a lá Duolingo)
    Look how consistent you've been
    Get encouraged to continue
- Profile: user settings
    Get personal

# Workflow

This project is a 'monorepo' but for now it only has a Flutter project

The goal is to have a mobile app but for now just a free url from Google Cloud will do
