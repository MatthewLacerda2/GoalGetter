def get_define_objective_notes_prompt(objective_name: str, objective_description: str) -> str:
        
    return f"""
    ## Context
    
    The user has a recent new objective of '{objective_name}', described as: '{objective_description}'    
    You are an experienced expert in the user's chosen field and an AI-Tutor.
    
    
    ## Task
    
    You must write some 'nice-to-know' notes about the objective. Things good to know in advance.
    
    These can be things good to know beforehand, common pitfails, advice, and small-but-useful information.
    All these notes must be relevant and very useful. Only write very nice to know stuff.
    
    Prefer things of impact over little things.
    
        
    ## Format
    
    You will return a GeminiObjectiveNotesList. Each item has the fields:
    - title: The optional title of the note
    - info: The information
    
    The title MUST be very short, less than 10 words.
    The title can also be empty and then you just focus on the info.
    
    The information can be longer, less than 40 words, but MUST be a single paragraph.
    
    Write no more than 10 notes. Write at least 3 notes.
    
    The content you write MUST be in the language of the user's objective.
