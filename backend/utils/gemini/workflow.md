# Onboarding

## Prompt

- Ask the user what he wants to learn
- Offer some curated courses

## Investigate

If what he wants is impossible/forbidden, kick him to the curb

- Why does the user wanna learn?

## Propose

- Show what is your plan and let the user confirm it

If he clicks 'no':
- Say 'oh no, how sad'
- Restart

If he clicks 'yes':
- Save the goal, objective, context
- Search for resources
- Generate notes
- Generate lesson

# UX

- User clicks 'lets do lesson'
    - We store info as he does it, accordingly

    - At the end of it we:
        - Generate more context and info, accordingly
        - Track progress
        
        By how much the user gets right, and how well, we define their progress
